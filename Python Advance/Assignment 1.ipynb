    "## Q1. What is the purpose of Python's OOP?\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of Python's OOP is to make code more reusable, maintainable, and extensible. OOP allows us to model real-world objects and their relationships in code, which makes it easier to understand and write complex programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Q2. Where does an inheritance search look for an attribute?\n",
    "\n",
    "An inheritance search looks for an attribute in the following order:\n",
    "\n",
    "The current class.\n",
    "The parent classes of the current class, in order from the most specific to the least specific.\n",
    "The built-in Python classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Q3. How do we distinguish between a class object and an instance object?\n",
    "\n",
    "A class object is a blueprint for creating instances of the class. It contains the class's attributes and methods. An instance object is a concrete representation of the class. It has its own unique set of values for the class's attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "To distinguish between a class object and an instance object, we can use the type() function. The type() function returns the type of an object. For a class object, the type() function will return the class itself. For an instance object, the type() function will return the class that created the instance object.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Q4. What makes the first argument in a class's method function special?\n",
    "\n",
    "The first argument in a class's method function is a special argument called self. The self argument represents the instance of the class on which the method is being called.\n",
    "\n",
    "All methods in a class must have a self argument. This allows methods to access and modify the instance's attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Q5. What is the purpose of the init method?\n",
    "\n",
    "The __init__ method is a special method that is called when a new instance of a class is created. It is used to initialize the instance's attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The __init__ method must have at least one argument, which is the self argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Q6. What is the process for creating a class instance?\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a class instance, we use the __new__() and __init__() methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "The __new__() method is used to create a new instance of the class. It returns a reference to the new instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The __init__() method is used to initialize the instance's attributes. It is called after the instance has been created by the __new__() method.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following code shows how to create a class instance:\n",
    "\n",
    "Python\n",
    "class Person:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Create a new instance of the Person class\n",
    "person = Person(\"Sawan\")\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Print the person's name\n",
    "print(person.name)\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "\n",
    "Sawan\n",
    "\n",
    "## Q7. What is the process for creating a class?\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a class, we use the class keyword. The following code shows how to create a simple class:\n",
    "\n",
    "Python\n",
    "class Person:\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "\n",
    "This code creates a class called Person. The pass statement is used to indicate that the class does not have any attributes or methods yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "we can add attributes and methods to a class by defining them inside the class definition. For example, the following code adds a name attribute and a greet() method to the Person class:\n",
    "\n",
    "Python\n",
    "class Person:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "\n",
    "    def greet(self):\n",
    "        print(f\"Hello, my name is {self.name}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Create a new instance of the Person class\n",
    "person = Person(\"Sawan\")\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Call the greet() method on the person instance\n",
    "person.greet()\n",
    "\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "\n",
    "Hello, my name is Sawan\n",
    "\n",
    "## Q8. How would we define the superclasses of a class?\n",
    "\n",
    "To define the superclasses of a class, we use the super() keyword. The super() keyword returns a reference to the parent class of the current class.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the following code defines a class called Child that inherits from the Parent class:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "class Parent:\n",
    "    def greet(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Hello from Parent!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class Child(Parent):\n",
    "    def greet(self):\n",
    "        super().greet()\n",
    "        print(\"Hello from Child!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Create a new instance of the Child class\n",
    "child = Child()"
   ]
