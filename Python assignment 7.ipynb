    "1. What is the name of the feature responsible for generating Regex objects?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: re.compile() function is responsible for generating Regex objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Why do raw strings often appear in Regex objects?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: Raw strings are often used in Regex objects because they allow you to use literal backslashes without having to escape them. \n",
    "This can make Regex objects more readable and easier to maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What is the return value of the search() method?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: The search() method returns a Match object if it finds a match in the string, or None if it does not find a match.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. From a Match item, how do you get the actual strings that match the pattern?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "# Step 1 - Need to import re module\n",
    "# Step 2 - Create a Regex object with the re.compile() function.\n",
    "# Step 3 - Pass the string from where you want to search the Regex object by using search() function. This statement\n",
    "#          returns a match object.\n",
    "# Step 4 - Call the match object's group() method to return the actual matched text.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. In the regex which created from the r&#39;(\\d\\d\\d)-(\\d\\d\\d-\\d\\d\\d\\d)&#39;, what does group zero cover?\n",
    "Group 2? Group 1?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:In the regex which created from the r'(\\d\\d\\d)-(\\d\\d\\d-\\d\\d\\d\\d)', Group 0 covers entire match result, group 1\n",
    "#    covers the first set of parentheses, and group 2 covers the second set of parentheses.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. In standard expression syntax, parentheses and intervals have distinct meanings. How can you tell\n",
    "a regex that you want it to fit real parentheses and periods?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:To tell a regex that you want it to match real parentheses and periods, you can escape them with a backslash. \n",
    "For example, to match the literal string (123) 456-7890, you would use the following regex:\n",
    "\n",
    "r'(\\(123\\) 456-7890)'\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "7. The findall() method returns a string list or a list of string tuples. What causes it to return one of\n",
    "the two options?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANs:The findall() method returns a string list or a list of string tuples. It'll return one of the two options if the\n",
    "   regex has no groups, list of strings is returned. If the regex has groups, list of tuples of strings is returned\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "8. In standard expressions, what does the | character mean?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:The | character in regex is the OR operator. \n",
    "It means that the regex will match any of the patterns that are separated by the | character. \n",
    "For example, the following regex will match either the string \"hello\" or the string \"world\":\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "r'hello|world'\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "9. In regular expressions, what does the character stand for?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:The . character in regex is the wildcard character. It matches any single character, except for newline characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "10.In regular expressions, what is the difference between the + and * characters?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:The + character in regex matches one or more occurrences of the preceding character. \n",
    "The * character in regex matches zero or more occurrences of the preceding character.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "11. What is the difference between {4} and {4,5} in regular expression?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:The {4} quantifier in regex matches exactly four occurrences of the preceding character. \n",
    "The {4,5} quantifier in regex matches four to five occurrences of the preceding character\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "12. What do you mean by the \\d, \\w, and \\s shorthand character classes signify in regular\n",
    "expressions?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:The \\d character class in regex matches any digit. \n",
    "The \\w character class in regex matches any alphanumeric character, including underscore. \n",
    "The \\s character class in regex matches any whitespace character, including spaces, tabs, and newlines.\n",
    "\n",
    "13. What do means by \\D, \\W, and \\S shorthand character classes signify in regular expressions?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:The \\D character class in regex matches any non-digit character. \n",
    "The \\W character class in regex matches any non-alphanumeric character, including underscore. \n",
    "The \\S character class in regex matches any non-whitespace character.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "14. What is the difference between .*? and .*?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:The .* performs a greedy match, and the .*? performs a nongreedy match.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "15. What is the syntax for matching both numbers and lowercase letters with a character class?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:The syntax for matching both numbers and lowercase letters with a character class is Either [0-9a-z] or [a-z0-9]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "16. What is the procedure for making a normal expression in regax case insensitive?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:To make a regular expression in regex case insensitive, you can use the re.IGNORECASE flag. \n",
    "For example, the following regex will match the string \"hello\" or \"HELLO\":\n",
    "\n",
    "r'hello', re.IGNORECASE\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "17. What does the . character normally match? What does it match if re.DOTALL is passed as 2nd\n",
    "argument in re.compile()?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:The . character normally matches any single character, except for newline characters. \n",
    "If re.DOTALL is passed as the second argument to re.compile(), the . character will match any single character, including newline characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "18. If numReg = re.compile(r&#39;\\d+&#39;), what will numRegex.sub(&#39;X&#39;, &#39;11 drummers, 10 pipers, five rings, 4\n",
    "hen&#39;) return?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: If numReg = re.compile(r'\\d+'), the return of numRegex.sub('X', '11 drummers, 10 pipers, five rings, 4 hen') will\n",
    "#     be 'X drummers, X pipers, five rings, X hens'\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "19. What does passing re.VERBOSE as the 2nd argument to re.compile() allow to do?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:The re.VERBOSE passing as the 2nd argument to re.compile() allows you to add whitespace and comments to the\n",
    "#     string passed to re.compile()\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "20. How would you write a regex that match a number with comma for every three digits? It must\n",
    "match the given following:\n",
    "&#39;42&#39;\n",
    "&#39;1,234&#39;\n",
    "&#39;6,368,745&#39;\n",
    "\n",
    "but not the following:\n",
    "&#39;12,34,567&#39; (which has only two digits between the commas)\n",
    "&#39;1234&#39; (which lacks commas)\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:A regex that match a number with comma for every three digits and match the following is :\n",
    "#     e.compile(r'^\\d{1,3}(,{3})*$')\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "21. How would you write a regex that matches the full name of someone whose last name is\n",
    "Watanabe? You can assume that the first name that comes before it will always be one word that\n",
    "begins with a capital letter. The regex must match the following:\n",
    "&#39;Haruto Watanabe&#39;\n",
    "&#39;Alice Watanabe&#39;\n",
    "&#39;RoboCop Watanabe&#39;\n",
    "but not the following:\n",
    "&#39;haruto Watanabe&#39; (where the first name is not capitalized)\n",
    "&#39;Mr. Watanabe&#39; (where the preceding word has a nonletter character)\n",
    "&#39;Watanabe&#39; (which has no first name)\n",
    "&#39;Haruto watanabe&#39; (where Watanabe is not capitalized)\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:re.compile(r'[A-Z][a-z]*\\sWatanabe')\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "22. How would you write a regex that matches a sentence where the first word is either Alice, Bob,\n",
    "or Carol; the second word is either eats, pets, or throws; the third word is apples, cats, or baseballs;\n",
    "and the sentence ends with a period? This regex should be case-insensitive. It must match the\n",
    "following:\n",
    "&#39;Alice eats apples.&#39;\n",
    "&#39;Bob pets cats.&#39;\n",
    "&#39;Carol throws baseballs.&#39;\n",
    "&#39;Alice throws Apples.&#39;\n",
