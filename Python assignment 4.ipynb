    "1. What exactly is []?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANs : [ ] is an empty list\n",
    "\n",
    "2. In a list of values stored in a variable called spam, how would you assign the value &#39;hello&#39; as the\n",
    "third value? (Assume [2, 4, 6, 8, 10] are in spam.)\n",

    "Ans: The value of spam[int(int('3' * 2) / 11)] is 'c'\n",

    "9. What are the list concatenation and list replication operators?\n",
    "Ans: The list concatenation operator is +, where it add two lists and the list replication operator is * where it replicate value in list by multiple of n integer no.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. What is difference between the list methods append() and insert()?\n",
    "ANs: The main difference between the append() and insert() methods is that append() adds an item to the end of a list, while insert() inserts an item at a specific index in a list.\n",

    "11. What are the two methods for removing items from a list?\n",
    "Ans: The two methods for removing items from a list are remove() and pop()\n",
    "\n",
    "12. Describe how list values and string values are identical.\n",
    "Ans:List values and string values are identical in that they are both sequences of characters. However, list values can be heterogeneous, meaning that they can contain different types of data, while string values are homogeneous, meaning that they can only contain characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "13. What&#39;s the difference between tuples and lists?\n",
    "Ans: The main difference between tuples and lists is that tuples are immutable, meaning that their values cannot be changed, while lists are mutable.\n",
    "\n",
    "14. How do you type a tuple value that only contains the integer 42?\n",
    "Ans: t = (42,)\n",

    "15. How do you get a list value&#39;s tuple form? How do you get a tuple value&#39;s list form?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: To get a list value's tuple form, you can use the following code:\n",
    "\n",
    "tuple(list_value)\n",
    "\n",
    "To get a tuple value's list form, you can use the following code:\n",

    "\n",
    "Ans:Variables that \"contain\" list values are not necessarily lists themselves. Instead, they contain references to lists\n",

    "\n",
    "17. How do you distinguish between copy.copy() and copy.deepcopy()?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANs: The main difference between copy.copy() and copy.deepcopy() is that copy.copy() creates a reference copy of a list, while copy.deepcopy() creates a deep or seperate copy of a list. If we change any value in the list from copied list it will also change value in original list while, while a deep copy copies the items themselves If we change any value in the list from copied list it will not change value in original list.\n"
