    "1. What advantages do Excel spreadsheets have over CSV spreadsheets?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "Excel spreadsheets have a number of advantages over CSV spreadsheets, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "Excel spreadsheets can contain multiple worksheets, while CSV spreadsheets can only contain one worksheet.\n",
    "Excel spreadsheets can contain formulas and functions, while CSV spreadsheets cannot.\n",
    "Excel spreadsheets can contain formatting, such as fonts, colors, and borders, while CSV spreadsheets cannot.\n",
    "Excel spreadsheets can contain charts and graphs, while CSV spreadsheets cannot\n",
    "\n",
    "2.What do you pass to csv.reader() and csv.writer() to create reader and writer objects?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: \n",
    "To create a reader object, we pass a file object to the csv.reader() function. To create a writer object, you pass a file object and a dialect to the csv.writer() function. A dialect is a set of rules for how to read and write CSV data.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the following code creates a reader object for a CSV file called example.csv:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "import csv\n",
    "\n",
    "with open(\"example.csv\", \"r\") as f:\n",
    "    reader = csv.reader(f)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The following code creates a writer object for a CSV file called example.csv with the excel dialect:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "import csv\n",
    "\n",
    "with open(\"example.csv\", \"w\") as f:\n",
    "    writer = csv.writer(f, dialect=\"excel\")\n",
    "    \n",
    "*if we will not use dialect then it will use default dialect\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What modes do File objects for reader and writer objects need to be opened in?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "The file object for a reader object needs to be opened in read mode (\"r\"). The file object for a writer object needs to be opened in write mode (\"w\") or append mode (\"a\").\n",
    "\n",
    "4. What method takes a list argument and writes it to a CSV file?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "The writer.writerow() method takes a list argument and writes it to a CSV file. The list should contain the values for each row in the CSV file.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the following code writes the list [\"name\", \"age\"] to the CSV file example.csv:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "import csv\n",
    "\n",
    "with open(\"example.csv\", \"w\") as f:\n",
    "    writer = csv.writer(f)\n",
    "    writer.writerow([\"name\", \"age\"])\n",
    "\n",
    "5. What do the keyword arguments delimiter and line terminator do?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "The delimiter keyword argument specifies the character that is used to separate the values in each row of the CSV file. The default delimiter is a comma.\n",
    "\n",
    "The line terminator keyword argument specifies the character or sequence of characters that is used to terminate each row of the CSV file. The default line terminator is a newline character (\"\\n\").\n",
    "\n",
    "6. What function takes a string of JSON data and returns a Python data structure?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "The json.dumps() function takes a Python data structure and returns a string of JSON data. The Python data structure can be a dictionary, list, or tuple.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "7. What function takes a Python data structure and returns a string of JSON data?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "json.loads() function takes a string of JSON data and returns a Python data structure.\n",
    "\n"
