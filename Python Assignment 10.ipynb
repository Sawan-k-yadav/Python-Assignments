    "1. How do you distinguish between shutil.copy() and shutil.copytree()?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: shutil.copy() copies a single file from one location to another. shutil.copytree() copies an entire directory tree, including all of its subdirectories and files.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "import shutil\n",
    "\n",
    "### Copy a single file\n",
    "shutil.copy(\"myfile.txt\", \"/new/location\")\n",
    "\n",
    "### Copy a directory tree\n",
    "shutil.copytree(\"/old/location\", \"/new/location\")\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What function is used to rename files??\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:The os.rename() function is used to rename files.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What is the difference between the delete functions in the send2trash and shutil modules?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: The send2trash.move_to_trash() function moves files and directories to the trash bin. The shutil.rmtree() function deletes files and directories permanently.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4.ZipFile objects have a close() method just like File objects’ close() method. What ZipFile method is\n",
    "equivalent to File objects’ open() method?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:The ZipFile() constructor is equivalent to File objects’ open() method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "import zipfile\n",
    "\n",
    "### Open a ZIP file\n",
    "with zipfile.ZipFile(\"myfile.zip\", \"r\") as zip_file:\n",
    "    # Read the contents of the ZIP file\n",
    "\n",
    "### Close the ZIP file\n",
    "zip_file.close()\n",
